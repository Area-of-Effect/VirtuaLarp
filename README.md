# GIB Games Presents: VRpg Roleplaying Game System
A system for creating RPG systems in VRChat.

## Requirements

This system requires:

## Installation

Import the above required packages. Then, import this package. 

## Usage

This package includes an example scene. Copy the contents of that scene into your scene if desired. For best results, unpack the VRpg prefab.

## In development

A character sheet system! I have already built a version for BNS vampire (for Dark Skylines) and one for 5e D&D. I am now in the process of cleaning it up and will be adding it shortly.
